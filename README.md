# cq

The standard CryptoQuip, as it appears in the comics, is a simple substitution
cypher where one part of the solution is provided, and it's up to the player to
figure out the rest from the provided cyphertext and the clue. It's a fun little
puzzle to play, but that doesn't stop a more _analytical_ approach.

This project is about a few different attacks on solving the general CryptoQuip
puzzle in as short a time as possible. There are other versions of this same
attack, and there are several different attack schemes. This just happens to be
the fastest we've found.

## Web Server Usage

At this time we have a limited web server in the `server` namespace, and it can
handle a few requests. To start it, simply:
```bash
$ lein run web
```
and then hit: `localhost:8080/` and you'll see the _hello_ output.

To see the benchmark code, hit:
```
GET localhost:8080/benchmark
```
and you'll see the cyphertext, the clue, and the plaintext. The log file has
all the details about what's being called, etc.

More endpoints to be added soon.

## Command Line Usage

Right now, there are tests that run a standard quip, and the `main` also runs
a standard quip - directing the output to `log/cq.log` for debugging and
monitoring purposes. Simply:
```bash
$ lein run block
```
and then the log will have something like:
```bash
